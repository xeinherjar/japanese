quickHiragana is a Python script that you can can use if you are on a machine without an IME.  Currently it only supports hiragana but I will add other options in the future.

--useage:
    ./qhg.py nihongo ha wakarimasu ka

    ~>  にほんご は わかります か

Note:
Currently it does not support any special characters or punctuation.

This was written in Python3 and the linux enviroment I used uses UTF-8 for the filesystem encoding.  If this isn't what you are running it may not work for you.
